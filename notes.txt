A100      2:30   BS 32
L4        4:20   BS 16
T4       24:40   BS 16, flash attention off
TPU v4e1  2:00   BS 16, flash attn off, checkpt off
TPU v4e1  2:00   BS 32, flash attn off, checkpt off

A100 is fastest. TPU is on same order but more complicated
A100 comparisons:
flash attn off, chpts off, cache on: OOM
flash attn off, chpts on, cache off: 5:30
flash attn on, chpts on, cache off: 2:30
flash attn on, chpts off, cache on: 2:10

Last configuration:
5 it/s
1 step = 32 lines with 1000 tokens = 30k tokens
150k tokens/s

Makes sense according to o3 bc. my model is so small.
